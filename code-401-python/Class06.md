## Design Patterns
**Design Patterns** is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers.

**Structural Design Patterns:** Structural Design Patterns:Structural design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Mostly they use Inheritance to compose all the interfaces. It also identifies the relationships which led to the simplification of the structure.

**Behavioral Design Pattern:** Behavioral patterns are all about identifying the common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

**Advantages of using Design Patterns**
- Reusability
- Transparent
- Established Solution
- Established Communication
- Efficient Development

## Analysis in Software Testing
### What Is Risk Analysis in Software Testing:
**Risk Analysis** is essential for software testing. In software testing, Risk Analysis is the process of identifying risks in applications and prioritizing them to test. A risk is a potential for loss or damage to an organization from materialized threats.

**Some of the risks could be:**
- New Hardware.
- New Technology.
- New Automation Tool.
- The sequence of code delivery.
- Availability of application test resources.

**In Software Testing, some unavoidable risk might take place like:**
- Change in requirements or incomplete requirements.
- Time allocation for testing.
- Developers were delaying to deliver the build for testing.
- Urgency from a client for delivery.
- Defect Leakage due to application size or complexity.


**Risk Identification**
***There can be a different type of risks include as follows:***

- Software_Risks: Knowledge of the most common risks associated with Software development, and the platform you are working on.
- Business Risk Analysis: The most common risks associated with the business using the Software.
- Testing_Risks: Knowledge of the most common risks associated with Software Testing for the platform you are working on, tools being used, and test methods being applied.
- Premature Release Risk: Ability to determine the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested Software Products.
- Risk Methods: Strategies and approaches for identifying risks or problems associated with implementing and operating information technology, products, and process; assessing their likelihood and initiating strategies to test those risks.

## Dependency injection
Dependency injection is a technique where an object, known as the client, receives all other objects, known as services, that it depends on.
**Why should I use dependency injection?** 
- Flexibility of configurable components — As the components are externally configured, there can be various definitions for a component(Control on application structure).
- Testing Made Easy — Instantiating mock objects and integrating with class definitions is easier.
High cohesion — Code with reduced module complexity, increased module reusability.
- Minimalistic dependencies — As the dependencies are clearly defined, easier to eliminate/reduce unnecessary dependencies.
