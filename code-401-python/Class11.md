# Matplotlib
**Matplotlib** is easy to use and an amazing visualizing library in Python. It is built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack and consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.
**Pyplot** is a Matplotlib module that provides a MATLAB-like interface. Pyplot provides functions that interact with the figure i.e. creates a figure, decorates the plot with labels, and creates a plotting area in a figure.
