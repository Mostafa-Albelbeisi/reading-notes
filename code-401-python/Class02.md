## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

**Test Driven Development (TDD) is a great approach for software development. TDD is nothing but the development of tests before adding a feature in code. This approach is based on the principle that we should write small codes rather than writing long codes. In TDD, whenever we want to add more functionality in our codes, we first have to write a test for that. After that, we add new functionality with small code lines combined and then test it with our test. This approach helps us to reduce the risk of encountering significant problems at the production level.**

## If name equals main
**Before the code is executed, the Python interpreter reads the source file and sets some private/global variables.**
**If the python compiler is running this module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the private __name__ variable to have the value "__main__". If this file was imported from another module, set __name__ to the module name. The module name is provided as a value for the global variable __name__.**

**A module is a file containing Python definitions and data. The file name is the name of the module with the .py suffix appended.**

## Recursion
**Python also accepts function iteration, which implies that the desired function can call itself. Recursion could be a common mathematical and programming concept. this suggests that the function calls itself. This has the benefit within the sense that you just can iterate the information to make a result. The developer has got to be very careful about handling recursion because it are often very easy to slide into writing a function that never ends, or a function that uses excessive amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly, recursive will be a awfully efficient and computationally elegant way of programming.**

## Python Lists
**Python lists are one of the most versatile data types that allow us to work with multiple elements at once.**
**In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets , separated by commas.[]**

**list of integers**
**my_list = [1, 2, 3]**

## Python Strings
**A string may be a sequence of characters. A character is just an emblem. for instance, the English language has 26 characters. Computers don't cope with characters, they handle numbers (binary). while you'll see characters on your screen, internally it's stored and manipulated as a mix of 0s and 1s. This conversion of character to variety is termed encoding, and therefore the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are a number of the popular encodings used. In Python, a string could be a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to incorporate every character all told languages and convey uniformity in encoding. you'll be able to find out about Unicode from Python Unicode.**

## Python Strings
**The module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file. It is an executable file and to organize all the modules we have the concept called Package in Python.**
**The package is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package. The package is simply a namespace. The package also contains sub-packages inside it.**


## Pytest Documentation
**pytest is that the framework that produces it easy to write down, test, and scale to support complex testing for applications and libraries. it's the foremost popular Python package for testing. the idea for an upscale ecosystem of testing is plugins and extensions.**

**The way pytest is meant is as a awfully extensible system, easy to jot down plugins and there are lots of plugins present within the pytest that are used for various purposes. Testing is incredibly important before delivering the code in production.**

**It is a mature full-featured Python tool that helps to jot down better programs.**

## PyTest Tutorial
**pytest enables you to form marks, or custom labels, for any test you wish. A test may have multiple labels, and you'll be able to use them for granular control over which tests to run. Later during this tutorial, you will see an example of how pytest marks work and find out how to form use of them in an exceedingly large test suite.**
