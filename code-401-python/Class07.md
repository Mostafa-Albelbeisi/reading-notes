# Data Analysis
**JupyterLab** enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:
- **Code Consoles** provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output.
- **Kernel-backed documents** enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
- **Notebook** cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers.
JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats.

**What is Jupyter Lab?**
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

# NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python
**NumPy** is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like **scikit-learn**(Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-learn is a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project.), that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

**NumPy** stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with an array. In Python, we use the list for purpose of the array but itâ€™s slow to process. NumPy array is a powerful N-dimensional array object and its use in linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. It provides an array object much faster than traditional Python lists.

**Types of Array:**
- One Dimensional Array
- Multi-Dimensional Array
