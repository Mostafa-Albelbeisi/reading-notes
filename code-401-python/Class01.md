## Big O notation
**The big O notation describes the complexity of code using algebraic operations/terms. They are used to classify algorithms according to how they run, space, or input size growth, and this coding is used to theoretically measure and compare worst-case scenarios of algorithms.**
**For any algorithm, Big-O parsing should be straightforward as long as we correctly define operations that depend on n, the input size.**

## Names and Values in Python
- The value is defined directly as
**x = 5;**
- We use print to create a print statement
- When we need to add a value to array we use append(): like

**num = [1, 2, 3]**

**num.append(4)**
- We use + to add a new value to a previous value
- The function is created by writing def fun

## Awesome Python Environment
**- The translate() method returns a string where some specified characters are replaced with the character described in a dictionary, or in a mapping table. Use the maketrans() method to create a mapping table. If a character is not specified in the dictionary/table, the character will not be replaced.**
**- Correctness from software engineering perspective can be defined as the adherence to the specifications that determine how users can interact with the software and how the software should behave when it is used correctly.**
**If the software behaves incorrectly, it might take considerable amount of time to achieve the task or sometimes it is impossible to achieve it.**
