## Data Structure
- **Data structure** is a data organization, managment and storage format that enabels efficient access and modification.
- **data structure** is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.  

**Some examples of how data structures are used include the following:**
1. Storing data 
2. Managing resources and services
3. Data exchange
4. Data exchange

**Data types:**
1. Boolean
2. integer
3. Floating-point numbers
4. Fixed-point numbers
5. String
6. Pointers
7. Character
**Types of data structures:**
1. Array
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Linked list
5. Tree
6. Graph

# Linked list

A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

**Linked List** is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.


## Linked List Representation
Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.
- Linked List contains a link element called first.
- Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.
- Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.
- Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.

## Basic Operations
Following are the basic operations supported by a list:
- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
- Display − Displays the complete list.
- Search − Searches an element using the given key.
- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
