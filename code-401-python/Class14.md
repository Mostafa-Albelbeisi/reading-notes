# Web scraping

**Web scraping** is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

**Web scraping** is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

Legitimate use cases include:
* Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.
* Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
* Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).

Web scraping **tools** are software (i.e., bots) programmed to sift through databases and extract information.

**Bot** types are used:
* Recognize unique HTML site structures
* Extract and transform content
* Store scraped data
* Extract data from APIs
