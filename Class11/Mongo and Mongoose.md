# nosql vs sql
**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**
SQL           | NoSQL
------------  | -------------
SQL databases are relational  | NoSQL databases are non-relational
SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema  | NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable  |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
 NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable  | NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores
SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions  | NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications

**Give a real world example.** analyze your grocery shopping habits

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?** JSON

**Give a real world example.** Product Data Management

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL

**Which type of database is best for scalability?** SQL

#
**What does SQL stand for?** Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?** is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?** rows and columns, which collectively form a table

**What is a 'schema'?** considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

**What is a NoSQL database?** are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables

**How does it work?** NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?** MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically JSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.** While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** Compatibility issues with SQL instructions. New databases use their own characteristics in the query language and they're not yet 100% compatible with the SQL used in relational databases. Support for work query issues in a NoSQL database is more complicated. Lack of standarization.Feb
