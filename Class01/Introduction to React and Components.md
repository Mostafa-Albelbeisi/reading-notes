# Component
**A component is a software object that is an architectural and portable set of replaceable and reusable functions and is intended to interact with other components. It is a configuration unit with a contractually defined interface. The component has three different views: an object-oriented view, a traditional view, and a process-related view.
The component has many properties, including:**
-	Reusability: components are designed to be reused in different situations in different applications
-	Components can be freely replaced by others
-	It is not context-specific as the components are designed to work in different environments and contexts
-	Extensible 
-	Encapsulated 
-	Independent standalone components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
Advantages of using component-based architecture:
-	Component-based architecture reduces development and maintenance costs.
-	It is reusable which means that it can be used for reusable components to spread the cost of development and maintenance across many applications.
-	Increases the reliability of the entire system by reusing.
-	It is easy to maintain and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
-	Modifies complexity using the component container and its services.
-	If new compatible versions are available, it is easy to replace existing versions without any impact on other components.

# Props
**Props are a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is used to pass data from one component to another. But here is that the data with props is passed in a one-way flow. (one parent-to-child method) Moreover, props data is read-only, which means that data from parents should not be changed by child components.**
props used in React:
-	First, define an attribute and its value (data)
-	Then pass it to the child component(s) using props
-	Finally, view the props data
Props are arguments passed to components and prop is an object.
