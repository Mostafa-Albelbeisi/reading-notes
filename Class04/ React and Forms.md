#  React and Forms

**1- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?** Controlled Components are those in which form's data is handled by the component's state.

**2- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.** update it based on user input and only updated with setState(). The displayed value will update as the user types.

**3- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?** Using event properties

#
**1- Why would we use a ternary operator?** for decision making in place of longer if and else conditional statements.

**2- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:** 


    if(x===y){console.log(true);} else {console.log(false);}}

    using ternary statement:

    x === y ? 'true' : 'false';
